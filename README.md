## 🌟 **Features**  
✅ **Run SQL Queries** directly on CSV files—because spreadsheets deserve more respect!  
✅ **Instant Schema Detection** for easy reference—no more guessing column names.  
✅ **Lightning Fast ⚡**—powered by Flask & Pandas for smooth performance.  
✅ **Zero Setup**—no need for traditional databases or config headaches.  
✅ **Simple & Interactive UI**—because querying data should be fun, not frustrating.

## 🎨 **How It Works**  
1️⃣ **Add a CSV link** – No database required!  
2️⃣ **Write SQL queries** – Use standard SQL syntax to explore your data.  
3️⃣ **Get instant results** – Structured output, just like a real database.  



SCHEMASPHERE makes data querying effortless—because who needs complicated database setups anyway? 😎💡

## 🛠 **Technologies & Tools Used**  

- **Backend:** Flask (Python) for handling HTTP requests and query processing.  
- **Database:** SQLite (in-memory) for fast and efficient querying.  
- **Frontend:** HTML & CSS for a structured, lightweight UI.  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas for loading, managing, and querying CSV data.  
- **HTTP Requests:** Requests library for fetching CSV files dynamically.

## ⚡ **Performance & Optimizations**  

### 🕒 **Measuring Execution Time**  
- Query execution time is measured using Python’s `time.time()`, capturing the duration of processing.  
- Additional performance insights gathered using **Chrome DevTools** and **Lighthouse**.  
- Average response time: **Under 200ms** for most queries (dataset size dependent).  

### 🚀 **Optimizations for Speed & Efficiency**  
- **In-Memory SQLite Database:** Temporary storage for quick queries without disk overhead.  
- **Optimized Query Execution:** Queries are handled via Pandas’ `read_sql_query()`, improving performance.  
- **Lazy Data Loading:** CSV files load **only when needed**, reducing memory usage.  
- **Lightweight Frontend:** No bloated JavaScript frameworks—just fast and clean UI.
